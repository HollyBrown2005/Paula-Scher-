                    <blockquote>
                        <p> Paula Scher, born October 6th, 1948, is an American Graphic designer, illustrator, and art educator. She has worked relentlessly since the 1970’s to revolutionise the graphic design industry with her obsessive determination and creative work. But how exactly has she transformed graphic design? In this essay I will discuss Paula Scher, focusing on her bold typography, specifically used in the series Bring in ‘da noise, bring in ‘da funk (1995) and how she uses typography as a branding tool. I will also describe and analyse the influence that she has brought to postmodernism design and her lasting legacy over the last forty years.</p>

                      <h2>Postmodernism</h2>
                      <p>Postmodernism is what came after modernist design, the prevailing aesthetic, style of the early mid 20th century, it can describe everything that came after modernism. (99 Designs, Johnny levanier, 2022). Post modernism became a movement in the 70’s and carried through to the 80’s, it rejected formal art instructions and theories, shattering traditional concepts. This is a significant movement as it introduced a new era of freedom and a sense that ‘anything goes’ (Tate, art Term). When Paula made Bring in ‘da Noise Bring in ‘da Funk (1995) it really signalled a paradigm shift, a new moment in the theatre. She figured out a way to take what she saw on stage and turn it into ink on paper. (Abstract The Art of Design time Netflix, 19:22). At the time this was the peak of postmodern graphic design. Set against a specific historical backdrop, the posters utilize a sans-serif typeface and combine elements of constructivism, graphic photography, and unique expressive techniques to transcend the limitations of postmodern graphic design, achieving a harmonious unity of form and function (Hill Publishing, Shao Yang, September 9th, 2024).  The series became popular as it reflected the culture and the graffiti streets of New York. Scher persuaded viewers with the posters by creating a system where the poster echoed the atmosphere of the theatre. This leads me to my next point which is how Scher uses her typography as a branding tool.</p>

                <h2>Typography</h2>

                <p> Scher’s approach to typography has always been unconventional. Her work never stuck to the principles of being minimalistic. Her work has always been more expressive compared to others. She creates typefaces that involve different weights, overlapping and stretching to evoke mood and personality. Although her work in unconventional, it is visually compelling to look at. Scher has designed for some of the world’s most recognisable brands. From Microsoft, Bloomberg, Citibank and Tiffany & Co. to vast sections of New York City’s cultural landscape (including but not limited to: The Public Theatre, the New York Philharmonic, the New York Botanical Garden, Jazz at Lincoln Centre, the Museum of Modern Art and the New York City Ballet (Design Week Molly Long 27th November 2019) </P>

                                <P> “It was so sexist it was good for me” </P>

                <h2> Lasting Legacy </h2>

                <P> During Paula Schers career, she found that the industry was hugely male dominated. Scher often occupied spaces as one of the only women in the room.  (Design Week Molly Long 27th November 2019). On the Design week interview Paula states that working in the business was “so sexist it was good for me”, using humour was the only way Paula felt seen.  Over time this proved to have an impact on the designer, causing her to leave the business in 1989.  Two years later Scher decided to join the organisation Pentagram as the first female partner. </P>

                <P> In conclusion Scher’s risks and her passion to challenge and experiment has revolutionised design by showing designers that it’s acceptable to have an innovative mind set and to be more playful when it comes to typography and design. Scher work is about expressing stories that resonate on an emotional level rather than solely focusing on creating functional visuals. She has revolutionised the design world with her ability to be fearless with her typography and blend art with functionality. I’d also like to include that Paula Scher had a huge impact specifically on female designers due to her being the first women to be a principal at the Pentagram New York. Not only was she a breath of fresh air to design, but she also inspired women to be a part of the industry, increasing the popularity of typography and design. </P>
